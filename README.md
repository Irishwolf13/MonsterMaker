# Monster Maker
Here in this lab, you can create your own personal Monsters!  Choose what they look like, what type of weapons they wield, how much armor they carry, their movement speed, attack rating, current level and so much more!  Mix and match their stats to create your own perfect crew of monsters

## Description
This app is a single page application that feels like so much more.  After creating a profile, you can create your own monsters and then put them into crews to use for your own game. (perhaps as I expand this app, I'll add a game feature)

## Installation
Although this app was made as a school project, if you'd like to clone it down and install it, all you will need to do is go into the root directory, run rails s, then into the client directory and run npm start, and you'll be up and running.

## Usage
This is a school project with no real use expect the knowledge I've learned while creating it.

## Contributing
Currently, this is a solo project, but you're welcome to inquire directly to me at rooneyjohn@gmail.com

## Credits
The major credit goes to the artist Olekzandr Zahorulko, who's creature creation skills is simply insane!!  I found endless inspiration from his artwork, and almost all of the artwork on this website is his.  You can check out his work at: https://www.artstation.com/alekzanderzagorulko

## License
All of the rights to the artwork belong to Olekzandr Zahorulko.  Everything else is free use as far as I am concerned.  I made this project at Flatiron bootcamp, for my final project.

## Contact
I will be shocked if anyone ever reads this, but if you do, I'd love to hear from you.  rooneyjohn@gmail.com
